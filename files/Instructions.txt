You have found a peculiar document named ciphered.txt and you want to decipher it!
Luckily you overheard two people taking about the document.
You know that it is ciphered with a XOR-cipher and that the key is a permutation / anagram of Edument ( e.q Eeunmtd or tndemuE).
You could try all 5040 (7!) keys and manually look for the hidden message. But since you are a clever programmer
you want to use the fact that the message is padded with scrambled english words.

Good luck!
